In order to use the password generator you need to first press the 'Generate Password' button. This will then direct you to a series of prompts that allow you to determine the lenght of the password, whether you want to include special characters, lowercase characters or uppercase characters and numeric characters. The password is then only generated if at least one character type is selected. Once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.
